# Hate_Speech_Detection
Roman Urdu Hate Speech Detection Using Deep Neural Networks
### We are working on a text based Classification Problem
We have roman urdu dataset of tweets which contain two classes Offensive  and Neutral
We will be using different Sequential and Attention models to solve this problem and get the best results
### Untill now we have used pre-trained Word2vec embeddings with Bi-Directional Lstm and get 70% to 71% Accuracy
### Main reason for poor performnace was lack of targeted words in embeddings and lack of data set
### After solving both issues by training new embeddings and adding new dataset Now scores have improved
### *Now Bi-Directional Lstm's are giving 92% acuracy*
