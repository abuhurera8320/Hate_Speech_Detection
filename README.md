# Hate_Speech_Detection
Roman Urdu Hate Speech Detection Using Deep Neural Networks
### We are working on a text based Classification Problem
We have roman urdu dataset of tweets which contain two classes Offensive  and Neutral
We will be using different Sequential and Attention models to solve this problem and get the best results
### Untill now we have used pre-trained Word2vec embeddings with Bi-Directional Lstm and get 70% to 71% Accuracy

### We have applied Simple RNN's and keras embedding layer and it has out-performed Bi-Lstm with pretrained layer and give 85% accuracy
